# Spring for GraphQL Practice: Books Project

This project was build as an extension of Dan Vega's tutorial on Spring for GraphQL. Everything included in the first commit was purely coded as a code along exercise and the rest builds on top of that.

<!-- TODO: write out what exactly the starting pack (Dan's code) does, and what you did on top of that (CRUD, JPA, DB connection, etc.) -->
<!-- TODO: introduce the app -- what it does -->
<!-- TODO: introduce all app's endpoints -->

If you want to test out the application, run the Spring Boot application which will run on port 8080, and then you can use the GraphiQL UI located at http://localhost:8080/graphiql.
